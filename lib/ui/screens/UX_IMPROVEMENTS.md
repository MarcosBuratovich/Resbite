# UX Improvement Plan for Resbite App

## 1. Core UX Principles to Implement

### Clarity and Consistency
- **Consistent Color Application**: Apply the new color palette (#89CAC7, #462748, #EFB0B4) consistently across all screens
- **Typography Hierarchy**: Create a clear visual hierarchy with the Montserrat font family
- **Consistent Navigation**: Ensure predictable navigation patterns throughout the app
- **Content Organization**: Group related information and actions logically

### Accessibility
- **Color Contrast**: Ensure text meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- **Touch Targets**: Make interactive elements min 44x44 points
- **Text Scaling**: Support dynamic text sizing for users with vision needs
- **Screen Reader Support**: Add semantic labels to all interactive elements

### Feedback & Error Prevention
- **Loading States**: Add clear loading indicators for all async operations
- **Success Confirmations**: Provide visual and textual confirmation for completed actions
- **Error Recovery**: Offer helpful solutions when errors occur
- **Form Validation**: Validate input as users type, not just on submission

### Efficiency
- **Prominent Actions**: Make primary actions stand out visually
- **Smart Defaults**: Pre-fill inputs with sensible defaults where possible
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Break complex tasks into smaller steps
